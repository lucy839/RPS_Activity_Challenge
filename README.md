## Conflicts & Solution
-   Dealing with firebase, and 2 users were extremely challening. Learning and practicing how to store and achieve data 
    from firebase helped resolving the conflicts. Functioning chat was also difficult, but resources gathered from google helped.

-   javascript, jQuery, and firebase

## Future
-   Incorporate User Authentication will make this game more professional
